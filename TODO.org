* NOW
1. Finish up eris/eris.h.

2. Modify VM to support calls out to C funcs with the stack-based interface.
   This may involve putting tags on stack frames. They might need this anyway
   for exceptions.

* SOON
- Figure out and *write down* a description of the bootstrapping process.

- Figure out how GC is gonna work & make it work.

- Figure out how exceptions are gonna work.

- Figure out how we're gonna deal with return stack overflows. Can we statically
  guarantee the return stack won't overflow before the register stack?

* EVENTUALLY
# Empirical performance questions
- Would representing nil as NULL speed us up? Would need to change
  representation of "undefined" in cells.
