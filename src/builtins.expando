/* This is an expando-style header. It is meant to be included with the BUILTIN
 * defined to something that will do a useful thing for each builtin definition.
 * As such, it has no include guards.
 *
 * BUILTIN(name, ...)
 *
 * - name: the name of the builtin. all caps, suitable for use in a macro name.
 *
 * - __VA_ARGS__: code that evaluates the builtin. expects the following macros
 *   to be defined:
 *
 *   - NARGS: number of arguments
 *   - ARG(i): ith argument
 *   - DEST: location to put the result value in.
 *   - ARITY_ERROR(): signals an arity error.
 *   - TYPE_ERROR(): signals a type error.
 *   - UNIMPLEMENTED: signals the builtin is unimplemented.
 *
 *   TODO: TYPE_ERROR (and maybe ARITY_ERROR?) should take args to indicate what
 *   failed.
 *
 *   Headers that must be included for code to work:
 *   - vm_util.h
